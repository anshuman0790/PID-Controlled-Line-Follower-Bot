# PID-Controlled-Line-Follower-Bot
This project involved the design, construction and programming of a line follower robot using the PID controller algorithm. The robot used an array of 5 IR sensors and a PID controller to adjust the speed of the motors so that the robot stays on the line. It was implemented using Arduino UNO microcontroller and programming was done in Arduino IDE.
